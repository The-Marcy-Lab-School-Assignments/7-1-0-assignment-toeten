# Question

What are the steps to incorporating context into your application?

# Answer
You must first import `createContext` from React and implement it with an empty object. Then, wrap your component tree with `MyContext.Provider` and pass in the value you want to share. Import `useContext` and the context you created; then you can use `useContext` to access the shared data.
